# CoreVital Case Studies

Case studies documenting how CoreVital was used in practice: problem, setup, metrics that mattered, and outcomes.

Case studies based on production model runs (Llama, Mistral, Mixtral, Qwen) are in progress.

## Adding a case study

1. Copy [TEMPLATE.md](TEMPLATE.md) to a new file, e.g. `repetition-debug-2026-02.md`.
2. Fill in the sections (problem, setup, metrics, results, lessons).
3. Open a PR or add the file to this repo.

Keep case studies concise (1-2 pages). Screenshots or anonymized report snippets are welcome.
