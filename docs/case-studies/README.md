# CoreVital case studies

This folder holds **case studies** that describe how CoreVital was used in practice: problem, setup, metrics that mattered, and outcomes.

## Purpose

- Share real-world usage and configurations.
- Show how risk score, health flags, and narratives led to decisions.
- Give others a template to contribute their own stories.

## Examples

- **[Example: Detecting Repetition Loops](example.md)** — Production LLM API debugging repetition issues using CoreVital's health flags and risk scores.

## Adding a case study

1. Copy [TEMPLATE.md](TEMPLATE.md) to a new file, e.g. `my-company-llm-qa.md` or `repetition-debug-2026-02.md`.
2. Fill in the sections (problem, setup, metrics, results, lessons).
3. Open a PR or add the file to this repo.

Keep case studies concise (1–2 pages). Screenshots or anonymized report snippets are welcome.
